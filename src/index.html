<h1>Hello World?</h1>
<h1>Learning to Draw</h1>
<p>Let's get re-acquainted with the pencil. I know you might use a pencil every day to write, but you may not use it every day to draw. Get your lap desk out and put a sheet or two of paper on it and get comfortable in front of your computer. Sharpen your 5B pencil. Now scribble on your paper. Yeah, I'm serious, scribble. Try not to make real straight lines with really sharp angles. Draw big circles and waves that go from one corner of the paper to the other. Draw arches and sweeping curves, and don't pick your pencil up off the paper, make one continuous line. Now, as you get used to doing that, as you make a downward stroke, press harder on the pencil to make a darker line. On an upstroke let up on the pressure to make a lighter line. Try and make the gradient from light to dark a gradual one. Draw a large circle in one stroke (it doesn't have to be a perfect circle, an oval will do), and try and make the bottom of the circle a dark line, and the top of the circle a light line. You're making this circle all in one stroke, right? This is kinda fun, right? Now try and make a pear shape that's darker on it's bottom. You can stop scribbling anytime you'd like, just do this for a few minutes.</p>

 <p>Now that you're limbered up, this first exercise will get you thinking about all the drawing elements we just talked about on the previous page and you probably won't even know it. Get your lap desk out and take your scribbles off, and clip on a few fresh sheets of paper and get comfortable in front of your computer. Sharpen your 5B pencil.</p>
